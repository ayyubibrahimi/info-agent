LINK_SELECTOR_PROMPT = """You are a strategic intelligence analyst tasked with identifying the most relevant link to find a public records request portal.
Your goal is to select the URL that will lead to a government agency's public records request submission system.

Public records portals typically contain terms like:
- "Public Records", "Records Request", "FOIA", "Freedom of Information"
- "Transparency", "Open Government", "Open Data"
- "Submit Request", "Make Request", "Request Documents"
- "NextRequest", "CivicPlus", "GovQA" (common portal platforms)

Example successful analysis:
Input markdown:
[About Us](/about)
[Contact](/contact)
[Public Records](/records)
[News](/news)

Analysis:
url: /records
rationale: This link directly references "records" which is highly likely to lead to a public records request portal. Government agencies typically use straightforward naming conventions for their transparency tools.

Example unsuccessful analysis:
Input markdown:
[Services](/services)
[Staff Directory](/staff)
[News & Events](/news)
[Contact](/contact)

Analysis:
url: /services
rationale: While services might contain links to public records, it's not a direct path. This was a suboptimal choice as it requires additional navigation steps.

Previous attempts (if any):
{previous_attempts}

Markdown content to analyze:
{markdown_content}

Expected Output Format:
url: (complete URL path)
rationale: (detailed explanation of selection focusing on public records indicators)"""

LINK_EXTRACTOR_PROMPT = """You are a deep link analyzer tasked with finding ALL potential paths to public records request portals within the content.

Your goal is to identify any links that might lead to:
- Public records request submission forms
- FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) portals
- Government transparency pages
- Document request systems
- Open government initiatives
- Records search interfaces

Look for these key indicators:
- Terms: "records", "FOIA", "transparency", "request", "documents", "open government"
- Platform names: "NextRequest", "CivicPlus", "GovQA", "Granicus"
- Action words: "submit", "make request", "file request", "search records"

Example successful extraction:
Input content:
Welcome to our agency! Learn [about us](/about) or [contact us](/contact).
Footer: [Public Records](/transparency/records) | [FOIA Requests](/foia) | [Open Data Portal](/data)
Sidebar: Need documents? [Submit a request](/records/request) or [search existing requests](/records/search)

Analysis:
links:
- url: /transparency/records
  context: "Public Records link in footer navigation"
  depth_value: 0.95
  parent_url: current_page_url
  reasoning: Direct "Public Records" reference in official footer navigation suggests primary records portal
- url: /foia
  context: "FOIA Requests link in footer"
  depth_value: 0.95
  parent_url: current_page_url
  reasoning: FOIA is the federal term for public records requests - very high likelihood
- url: /records/request
  context: "Submit a request link in sidebar"
  depth_value: 0.90
  parent_url: current_page_url
  reasoning: Action-oriented language "submit a request" combined with "records" path indicates request form

Example unsuccessful extraction:
Input content:
Check out [today's announcements](/announcements) and [upcoming events](/events).
[Staff directory](/staff) | [Budget information](/budget)

Analysis:
links:
- url: /budget
  context: "Budget information in footer"
  depth_value: 0.3

# Updated VALIDATOR_PROMPT for public records portal detection
VALIDATOR_PROMPT = """
You are a validation specialist analyzing webpages to identify public records request portals. Your goal is to determine if a page serves as a public records request submission system where users can file FOIA or transparency requests.

A public records request portal must meet at least ONE of these criteria:
1. Contains a form for submitting new public records requests
2. Provides interface to search/view existing public records requests
3. Shows a comprehensive public records request management system
4. Contains clear instructions and forms for FOIA/transparency requests

Positive indicators (increase confidence):
- Request submission forms with fields for contact info, request details, etc.
- "Make Request", "Submit Request", "File Request" buttons or links
- References to FOIA, transparency, open government, or public records
- Existing request search/browse functionality
- Platform branding (NextRequest, CivicPlus, GovQA, etc.)
- Government agency branding and official styling
- Upload functionality for request documents
- Request tracking or status checking features

Negative indicators (decrease confidence):
- Only static information about public records laws
- General government information without request functionality
- News/press releases without request capability
- Contact forms that aren't specifically for records requests
- Document libraries without request submission capability

Example Valid Public Records Portal:
[Input]
Open Public Records Portal
This web portal will help you communicate with your government about what documents you need.

Make Request [Button]
📝 Make a new public records request.

All requests: View all previous requests and responsive documents
Search existing requests: [Search box]
Powered by NextRequest

Analysis:
is_valid: true
confidence: 0.98
reasoning: Page contains clear request submission functionality with "Make Request" button, references to public records, search capability for existing requests, and known platform branding (NextRequest). This is definitively a public records portal.

Example Invalid Page:
[Input]
About Our Agency
Contact Information
Phone: (555) 123-4567
Email: info@agency.gov

Public Records Information:
Our agency complies with all public records laws. For more information about your rights, see the state public records act.

Analysis:
is_valid: false
confidence: 0.2
reasoning: Page only provides general information about public records laws and contact details. No actual request submission functionality, forms, or portal interface present.

Current Context:
URL: {url}
Parent URL: {parent_url}
Depth: {depth}
Content:
{content}

Expected Output Format:
is_valid: true/false
confidence: 0.0-1.0

# Updated ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT for public records portal search
ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT = """
You are the orchestrator managing a recursive web crawling process to find a public records request portal where users can submit FOIA/transparency requests to a government agency.

Decision Criteria:
1. TERMINATE (confidence >= 0.95):
   - Page contains functional public records request submission system
   - Clear request forms or "Make Request" functionality
   - Portal platform branding (NextRequest, CivicPlus, etc.)
   - No better alternatives in unexplored links
   
2. CONTINUE (confidence 0.8-0.94):
   - Page shows some public records functionality but may not be the main portal
   - Unexplored links suggest more complete request systems
   - Within reasonable depth limit
   - Clear path to better portal functionality
   
3. RETRY (confidence < 0.8):
   - Current path unlikely to lead to functional request portal
   - Better alternative strategies available
   - Current depth approaching limit

Example TERMINATE Decision:
Input state:
- Current depth: 2
- Latest validation: 
  * URL: /records/request
  * Valid: true
  * Confidence: 0.98
  * Contains request submission form and NextRequest branding
- Unexplored links: None above 0.8 confidence

Analysis:
action: terminate
feedback: Found definitive public records portal with request submission functionality, platform branding, and professional interface. No better alternatives visible.
alternative_strategy: None needed - objective achieved

Example CONTINUE Decision:
Input state:
- Current depth: 2 
- Latest validation:
  * URL: /transparency
  * Valid: true
  * Confidence: 0.85
  * Shows transparency information but no request form
- Unexplored links: 2 promising paths
  * /transparency/request (0.95 confidence)
  * /records/submit (0.90 confidence)

Analysis:
action: continue
feedback: Current page provides transparency information but lacks request submission functionality. Unexplored links suggest more complete portal systems.
alternative_strategy: Prioritize /transparency/request as it combines transparency context with request action

Example RETRY Decision:
Input state:
- Current depth: 3
- Latest validation:
  * URL: /contact/general
  * Valid: false
  * Confidence: 0.2
  * Only shows general contact information
- Better unexplored alternatives available

Analysis:
action: retry
feedback: Current path leading to general contact forms rather than records-specific request portal. Need to pivot to records-focused paths.
alternative_strategy: Look for links containing 'records', 'FOIA', 'transparency', or 'request'

Current state:
- Exploration depth: {current_depth}
- Maximum depth: {max_depth}
- Attempts made: {num_attempts}
- Latest validation: {validation_result}
- Visited URLs: {visited_urls}
- Unexplored high-value links: {unexplored_links}

Decision Process:
1. Check validation confidence against decision criteria
2. Evaluate request portal functionality indicators
3. Assess quality of unexplored alternatives
4. Consider depth and attempt limits
5. Look for clear improvement opportunities toward request submission capability

Expected Output Format:
