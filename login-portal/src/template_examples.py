EXAMPLE 8: State Data Check Letter (12+ records missing)

We appreciate your assistance in continuing to fill our requests. We would like to bring to your attention to releasable records that we are seeking that were not included in the previous production of records. We’ve identified incidents for which we believe records exist in the attached spreadsheet. 
These incidents were identified by information provided by your agency to the California Department of Justice per Cal Govt. Code sections 12525 and 12525.2, the laws that mandate law enforcement agencies in California report use-of-force incidents that result in serious bodily injury or death or involve the discharge of a firearm as well as in-custody deaths. 
If you cannot provide any of the records indicated above, please cite the relevant exemption in California’s public records law or an explanation detailing why the record is not releasable. 
We’re happy to receive clarifications and questions via electronic communication at any time, you can also follow up with a member of our team (Katey Rusch) at (510) 516-6277. Please let us know if you'd like for us to provide a link to upload documents. Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter.

As a reminder (though I'm sure you are aware), Cal Govt. Code 7922.545(b) says "if after the public agency directs a member of the public to the internet website, the member of the public requesting the public record requests a copy of the public record due to an inability to access or reproduce the public record from the internet website, the public agency shall promptly provide a copy of the public record pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 7922.530."
